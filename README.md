## Hello, esteemed candidate!

Thank you for your interest, for applying and for having the patience to go through the steps of the interviewing process. 
You made it past the first step, so we're confident that you have the potential to work in our team. This exercise is supposed to showcase some of your vital skills for handling some day to day problems in the wild.

We are aware of how tiring interviews can be, especially when you have to solve multiple tech challenges in a row, 
so please find your healthy balance between the time spent on this and the final product that is supposed to showcase your career so far as a professional software engineer. Don't spend more than a few hours on this. Write docs whenever you feel like you could do more but it would take too much time.

If there are any questions left or things unclear please contact us as soon as possible and weâ€™ll be happy to help you out.

## Task

**Create a simple notebook as a single page application.**
There should be a list of notes with the possibility to create, edit and delete items.

Code can reside in either one project or two separate repos for backend and frontend. 
The communication between frontend and backend should be done via ajax requests.
The user of the final product is not trusted (he could be malicious).

### Backend
The backend should be written in Go. Feel free to implement it either in plain golang or
use frameworks, but be ready to motivate your decision. Store data in a persistence layer or keep it in memory.

### Frontend
React is a must, while redux and typescript are optional, but would be appreciated.

#### Optional: Infra
Run everything in containers glued together by some basic orchestration (e.g. docker compose) and docs for running things on our side.

Please make the project available in a fork of this repo.
