## Hello, esteemed candidate!

Thank you for your interest, for applying and for having the patience to go through the steps of the interviewing process. 
You made it past the first step, so we're confident that you have the potential to work in our team. This exercise is supposed to showcase some of your vital skills for handling day to day problems in the wild.

Interviews can be tiring, especially when you have to solve multiple tech challenges in a row, so please find a good balance between the time spent on this and the final product that is supposed to showcase your career so far as a professional software engineer. So maybe don't spend more than a few hours on this. Or write docs which detail the shortcuts you chose to take.

This looks like a simple project, but there is perhaps no limit to what can be done, so choose your battles wisely and document the rest.

If there are any questions left please contact us as soon as possible and weâ€™ll be happy to help you out.

# The actual task

**Create a simple notebook as a single page application.**
There will be a list of notes with the possibility to create, edit and delete items (a basic crud for notes).

Code can reside in either one project or in two separate repos for backend and frontend.
The communication between frontend and backend should be done via ajax requests.
The user of the final product is not trusted.

### Backend
The backend should be written in **go** or, why not, **rust**. Feel free to use frameworks, but be prepared to motivate your decision. Store data in a persistence layer or keep it in memory.

### Frontend
React is a must, while redux and typescript are optional, but would be nice.

#### Optional: Infra
Run everything in containers glued together by some basic orchestration (e.g. docker compose) and write some docs for running things on our side.

Please make the project available in a **private** fork of this repo and don't forget to give me permissions to checkout the code.

Godspeed!
