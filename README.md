## Hello, esteemed candidate!

Thank you for your interest, for applying and for having the patience to go through the steps of the interviewing process. 
You made it past the first step of the process so we are confident that you have the potential to work in our team. 
This exercise is supposed to showcase some of your vital skills for handling some day to day problems in the wild.

We are aware of how tiring interviews can be, especially when you have to solve multiple tech challenges in a row, 
so please don't spend more than a few hours of your time on this one. 

Please read the information down below carefully. If there are any questions left or things unclear please contact us as soon as possible and weâ€™ll
be happy to help you out.

## Task

Create a simple notebook as a single page application. 
There should be a list of all the notes with buttons to delete existing items. It must be possible to
create and edit new notes.

Feel free to either put them into one project or separate them in two applications. 
Please make the project available in a fork of this repo.

The communication between frontend and backend should be done via ajax requests.
Keep in mind that the user of the final product could be malicious.

### Backend
The backend should be written in Go. Feel free to implement it either in plain Golang or
use frameworks, but be ready to motivate your decision. 
Store data in a persistence layer or keep it in memory.

### Frontend
React is a must, while redux and typescript are optional, but would be appreciated.

#### Optional: Infra
Run everything in containers glued together by some basic orchestration (e.g. docker compose) and docs for running things on our side.
